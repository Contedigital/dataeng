# Estonian Knowledge Graph

Hello!

On the topic of Tartu2024 and a cultural graph, while I agree with Jaak that most of the city's budget is probably already earmarked, here are some possible collaborations in Tartu. Of course, either the Tartu2024 team or the department of culture in the city government might also be interested.
The National Archive is participating in the Time Machine project. The contact person would probably be Sven Lepa (Sven.Lepa[at]ra.ee).
The people in Tartu city library are quite enthusiastic and have developed a database of places related to literature. You may have also noticed metal signs with citation-sized bits of text here and there in the city, they have led several literature-related projects.
For digital humanities in general, we have a DH society, that also holds an annual conference. Inside the institute, Kadri Vider (head of the Center of Estonian Language Resources) might know the most about who does what in Estonia in either digital humanities or topics relating to Estonian language.

With best regards
