# Survey on Relational Meets Graphs

## Todos

### identify the analysis dimensions
- what is the principal engine (SQL or graph or other)
- what is the graph representation they use (an rdf grah encoded in a single statement or a property graph represented using a label-table, pg as wide entity-oriented etc.)
- how do they decide that a part of the workload (query) deserves a specialized exeuctioner
	- how does the executioner differ from the main engine?
	- do they have a cost model? is the CM based on rules? statistics? other?
	- do they reason about query shape/operators?
