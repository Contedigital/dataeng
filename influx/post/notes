nella slide 19 non dovrebbe essere groupby _M

from bucket to table

N is a set of names

Tags is subset of N that identifies tag names
Fields is subset of N that identifies filed names

value :: N -> Data Domain
M is measurement names 

key:: M x { v | value(t) in Tags} x Fields X Time

key = _m | t | _field | timestamp
	  value(_m), value(t), value()
table(l)
	|start,stop|key|_value


filter does not change table key

group change the table key 

-> exercise on group to identify the new group key
-> exercise on shaping that asks to identify the operation solution should be based on group key

exercise with mean and last
exercise with aggregateWindow
