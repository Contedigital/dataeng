- Course Projects:
	- using course projects to improve research tools
    - typically i use course projects to explore new research lines. this is often unsustainable because the student is not independent and the feedback-loop contrasts with the exploratory nature of the work
    - additionally, course projects are never longer than a semester, and cannot claim the full time of the student
    - since next year we need to restrict the standard projects to a form of assignment that leads to achieve a bit of independence 
    - we can still immagine research project, but their scope will be maintenance or improving existing works
    - examples of this are:
        - redoing the evaluation of an existing work, better if published already. with the goal of [[reproducibility]]  and/or [[repeatability]]
        - improving the tooling for an evaluation to get better results, e.g., reduce error or measuring better error
        - standardizing the evaluation procedure
            - crearing a wiki
            - creating docker images
            - creating and documenti scripts for running and plotting
