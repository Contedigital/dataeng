Title: Designing a personalized, adaptive learning environment for practicing Data Science

The goal for this master thesis is to design and develop an interactive environment that will support Data Science learners to master fundamental topics by providing personalized and adaptive instruction. This interactive environment should consist of three parts:

1. the front end will be implemented as a Jupyter notebook;
2. the back end will implement a student model that will be responsible for guiding the learning activity;
3. the middle layer that will be responsible for the communication between the front and the back end. To achieve this, the middle layer will record data regarding the studentâ€™s activity on the front end (for example, the programming commands the students type or the error messages they receive) and it will deliver the instruction that the student model prescribes to the student (for example, suggestions on how to solve an error or additional learning activities that the student should carry out).

This master thesis will be co-supervised by Irene-Angelica Chounta and Riccardo Tommasini.

This project aims to design and develop an interactive environment that will support Data Science learners to master fundamental topics by providing personalized and adaptive instruction.
Such an interactive environment should be implemented as an extension of the Jupyter Lab environment, awarded as a 2019 data science tool by ACM.
Leveraging a model that will be responsible for guiding the learning activity of students. the environment will be responsible for

record data about the student's activity on the front end (for example, the programming commands the students' type or the error messages they receive)
deliver the instructions that the student model prescribes to the student (for example, suggestions on how to solve an error or additional learning activities that the student should carry out).
Collect students' feedbacks and questions, for instance, using a chatbot.
