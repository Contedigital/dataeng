## Summary of the Paper

The paper proposes a formal comparison of two foundational ontologies, i.e.,
UFO and BFO. The paper idea comes from a concrete problem that the authors had: decide what foundational ontology use to model the safety model and methodology (STAMP). The comparison is done on the use-case of "conceptual modeling during domain domain-ontology design" using SABIo.

Comparing ontologies is an interesting and relevant problem experienced by everyone who approaches semantic technologies for knowledge representation.
Specifically for foundational ontologies, the problem assumes a more abstract
flavor, but welcomes more rigorousness as these ontologies are usually sustained by a formal framework.

On the other hand, use-case driven comparison can also be useful to guide potential adopters during their design choice. Nevertheless, this approach is not easy to generalize as it is by design situational. 
A possible evaluation techniques would require users that asses how easier is the ontology engineering tasks following the authors guidelines.

Unfortunately, the paper presents the comparison in the STAMP use-case as a general method and avoids any attempts to generalize the results to other use-cases. Thus, my overall evaluation reflects the current structure of the paper. What I think are really missing are more use-cases. However,  I understand it might be hard in such a limited space. 

Furthermore, the ontology engineering method of choice represents a further variable for the design of a comparison methodology. Thus, I suggest take to fix that (and move the related section in the introduction).

Finally, the idea of formulating competency questions to evaluate the alignment is interesting. However, I think these questions should be in part based on the foundational ontology of choice, as a sort of "alignment test" for the domain ontology to pass, in part based on the domain ontology as
for the knowledge engineers can evaluate their alignment.

In the following, I present some minor suggestions

- Section 5 and Section 6 can be reduced and unified.
- Section 3 can be also reduced. I understand the need of being self contained though.
- Section 7 is not really an evaluation, not even qualitative. I suggest "Put the BFO or UFO into practice".
- Reference 1 is missing
