# Our first containers

![inline](../attachments/title-our-first-containers.jpg)

---

## Objectives

At the end of this lesson, you will have:

* Seen Docker in action.

* Started your first containers.

* Understood what is an image.

* What is a layer.

* The various image namespaces.

* How to search and download images.

* Image tags and when to use them.

---

## Hello World

In your Docker environment, just run the following command:

```bash
$ docker run busybox echo hello world
hello world
```

(If your Docker install is brand new, you will also see a few extra lines,
corresponding to the download of the `busybox` image.)

---

## That was our first container!

* We used one of the smallest, simplest images available: `busybox`.

* `busybox` is typically used in embedded systems (phones, routers...)

* We ran a single process and echo'ed `hello world`.

---

## A more useful container

Let's run a more exciting container:

```bash
$ docker run -it ubuntu
root@04c0bb0a6c07:/#
```

* This is a brand new container.

* It runs a bare-bones, no-frills `ubuntu` system.

* `-it` is shorthand for `-i -t`.

  * `-i` tells Docker to connect us to the container's stdin.

  * `-t` tells Docker that we want a pseudo-terminal.

---

## Do something in our container

Try to run `figlet` in our container.

```bash
root@04c0bb0a6c07:/# figlet hello
bash: figlet: command not found
```

Alright, we need to install it.

---

## Install a package in our container

We want `figlet`, so let's install it:

```bash
root@04c0bb0a6c07:/# apt-get update
...
Fetched 1514 kB in 14s (103 kB/s)
Reading package lists... Done
root@04c0bb0a6c07:/# apt-get install figlet
Reading package lists... Done
...
```

One minute later, `figlet` is installed!

---

## Try to run our freshly installed program

The `figlet` program takes a message as parameter.

```bash
root@04c0bb0a6c07:/# figlet hello
 _          _ _       
| |__   ___| | | ___  
| '_ \ / _ \ | |/ _ \ 
| | | |  __/ | | (_) |
|_| |_|\___|_|_|\___/ 
```

Beautiful! .emoji[üòç]

---



## Counting packages in the container

Let's check how many packages are installed there.

```bash
root@04c0bb0a6c07:/# dpkg -l | wc -l
190
```

* `dpkg -l` lists the packages installed in our container

* `wc -l` counts them

How many packages do we have on our host?

---



## Counting packages on the host

Exit the container by logging out of the shell, like you would usually do.

(E.g. with `^D` or `exit`)

```bash
root@04c0bb0a6c07:/# exit
```

Now, try to:

* run `dpkg -l | wc -l`. How many packages are installed?

* run `figlet`. Does that work?

---



## Comparing the container and the host

Exit the container by logging out of the shell, with `^D` or `exit`.

Now try to run `figlet`. Does that work?

(It shouldn't; except if, by coincidence, you are running on a machine where figlet was installed before.)

---

## Host and containers are independent things

* We ran an `ubuntu` container on an Linux/Windows/macOS host.

* They have different, independent packages.

* Installing something on the host doesn't expose it to the container.

* And vice-versa.

* Even if both the host and the container have the same Linux distro!

* We can run *any container* on *any host*.

  (One exception: Windows containers cannot run on Linux machines; at least not yet.)

---

## Where's our container?

* Our container is now in a *stopped* state.

* It still exists on disk, but all compute resources have been freed up.

* We will see later how to get back to that container.

---

## Starting another container

What if we start a new container, and try to run `figlet` again?
 
```bash
$ docker run -it ubuntu
root@b13c164401fb:/# figlet
bash: figlet: command not found
```

* We started a *brand new container*.

* The basic Ubuntu image was used, and `figlet` is not here.

---

## Where's my container?

* Can we reuse that container that we took time to customize?

  *We can, but that's not the default workflow with Docker.*

* What's the default workflow, then?

  *Always start with a fresh container.*
  <br/>
  *If we need something installed in our container, build a custom image.*

* That seems complicated!

  *We'll see that it's actually pretty easy!*

* And what's the point?

  *This puts a strong emphasis on automation and repeatability. Let's see why ...*

---

## Local development with Docker

* With Docker, the workflow looks like this:

  * create container image with our dev environment

  * run container with that image

  * work on project

  * when done, shut down container

  * next time we need to work on project, start a new container

  * if we need to tweak the environment, we create a new image

* We have a clear definition of our environment, and can share it reliably with others.

* Let's see in the next chapters how to bake a custom image with `figlet`!

# Build first Image

![inline](../attachments/title-understanding-docker-images.png)

---
## What is an image?

* Image = files + metadata

* These files form the root filesystem of our container.

* The metadata can indicate a number of things, e.g.:

  * the author of the image
  * the command to execute in the container when starting it
  * environment variables to be set
  * etc.

* Images are made of *layers*, conceptually stacked on top of each other.

* Each layer can add, change, and remove files and/or metadata.

* Images can share layers to optimize disk usage, transfer times, and memory use.

---

## Example for a Java webapp

Each of the following items will correspond to one layer:

* CentOS base layer
* Packages and configuration files added by our local IT
* JRE
* Tomcat
* Our application's dependencies
* Our application code and assets
* Our application configuration

---



## The read-write layer

![inline](../attachments/container-layers.jpg)

---

## Differences between containers and images

* An image is a read-only filesystem.

* A container is an encapsulated set of processes,

  running in a read-write copy of that filesystem.

* To optimize container boot time, *copy-on-write* is used
  instead of regular copy.

* `docker run` starts a container from a given image.

---



## Multiple containers sharing the same image

![inline](../attachments/sharing-layers.jpg)

---

## Comparison with object-oriented programming

* Images are conceptually similar to *classes*.

* Layers are conceptually similar to *inheritance*.

* Containers are conceptually similar to *instances*.

---

## Wait a minute...

If an image is read-only, how do we change it?

* We don't.

* We create a new container from that image.

* Then we make changes to that container.

* When we are satisfied with those changes, we transform them into a new layer.

* A new image is created by stacking the new layer on top of the old image.

---

## A chicken-and-egg problem

* The only way to create an image is by "freezing" a container.

* The only way to create a container is by instantiating an image.

* Help!

![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/515qtu1LfUL._AC_SL1000_.jpg)

---

## Creating the first images

There is a special empty image called `scratch`.

* It allows to *build from scratch*.

The `docker import` command loads a tarball into Docker.

* The imported tarball becomes a standalone image.
* That new image has a single layer.

Note: you will probably never have to do this yourself.

---

## Creating other images

`docker commit`

* Saves all the changes made to a container into a new layer.
* Creates a new image (effectively a copy of the container).

`docker build` **(used 99% of the time)**

* Performs a repeatable build sequence.
* This is the preferred method!

We will explain both methods in a moment.

---

## Images namespaces

There are three namespaces:

* Official images

    e.g. `ubuntu`, `busybox` ...

* User (and organizations) images

    e.g. `jpetazzo/clock`

* Self-hosted images

    e.g. `registry.example.com:5000/my-private/image`

Let's explain each of them.

---

## Root namespace

The root namespace is for official images.

They are gated by Docker Inc.

They are generally authored and maintained by third parties.

Those images include:

* Small, "swiss-army-knife" images like busybox.

* Distro images to be used as bases for your builds, like ubuntu, fedora...

* Ready-to-use components and services, like redis, postgresql...

* Over 150 at this point!

---

## User namespace

The user namespace holds images for Docker Hub users and organizations.

For example:

```bash
jpetazzo/clock
```

The Docker Hub user is:

```bash
jpetazzo
```

The image name is:

```bash
clock
```

---

## Self-hosted namespace

This namespace holds images which are not hosted on Docker Hub, but on third
party registries.

They contain the hostname (or IP address), and optionally the port, of the
registry server.

For example:

```bash
localhost:5000/wordpress
```

* `localhost:5000` is the host and port of the registry
* `wordpress` is the name of the image

Other examples:

```bash
quay.io/coreos/etcd
gcr.io/google-containers/hugo
```

---

## How do you store and manage images?

Images can be stored:

* On your Docker host.
* In a Docker registry.

You can use the Docker client to download (pull) or upload (push) images.

To be more accurate: you can use the Docker client to tell a Docker Engine
to push and pull images to and from a registry.

---

## Showing current images

Let's look at what images are on our host now.

```bash
$ docker images
REPOSITORY       TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
fedora           latest    ddd5c9c1d0f2   3 days ago      204.7 MB
centos           latest    d0e7f81ca65c   3 days ago      196.6 MB
ubuntu           latest    07c86167cdc4   4 days ago      188 MB
redis            latest    4f5f397d4b7c   5 days ago      177.6 MB
postgres         latest    afe2b5e1859b   5 days ago      264.5 MB
alpine           latest    70c557e50ed6   5 days ago      4.798 MB
debian           latest    f50f9524513f   6 days ago      125.1 MB
busybox          latest    3240943c9ea3   2 weeks ago     1.114 MB
training/namer   latest    902673acc741   9 months ago    289.3 MB
jpetazzo/clock   latest    12068b93616f   12 months ago   2.433 MB
```

---

## Searching for images

We cannot list *all* images on a remote registry, but
we can search for a specific keyword:

```bash
$ docker search marathon
NAME                     DESCRIPTION                     STARS  OFFICIAL  AUTOMATED
mesosphere/marathon      A cluster-wide init and co...   105              [OK]
mesoscloud/marathon      Marathon                        31               [OK]
mesosphere/marathon-lb   Script to update haproxy b...   22               [OK]
tobilg/mongodb-marathon  A Docker image to start a ...   4                [OK]
```


* "Stars" indicate the popularity of the image.

* "Official" images are those in the root namespace.

* "Automated" images are built automatically by the Docker Hub.
  <br/>(This means that their build recipe is always available.)

---

## Downloading images

There are two ways to download images.

* Explicitly, with `docker pull`.

* Implicitly, when executing `docker run` and the image is not found locally.

---

## Pulling an image

```bash
$ docker pull debian:jessie
Pulling repository debian
b164861940b8: Download complete
b164861940b8: Pulling image (jessie) from debian
d1881793a057: Download complete
```

* As seen previously, images are made up of layers.

* Docker has downloaded all the necessary layers.

* In this example, `:jessie` indicates which exact version of Debian
  we would like.

  It is a *version tag*.

---

## Image and tags

* Images can have tags.

* Tags define image versions or variants.

* `docker pull ubuntu` will refer to `ubuntu:latest`.

* The `:latest` tag is generally updated often.

---

## When to (not) use tags

Don't specify tags:

* When doing rapid testing and prototyping.
* When experimenting.
* When you want the latest version.

Do specify tags:

* When recording a procedure into a script.
* When going to production.
* To ensure that the same version will be used everywhere.
* To ensure repeatability later.

This is similar to what we would do with `pip install`, `npm install`, etc.

---

## Section summary

We've learned how to:

* Understand images and layers.
* Understand Docker image namespacing.
* Search and download images.

# Compose for development stacks

Dockerfiles are great to build container images.

But what if we work with a complex stack made of multiple containers?

Eventually, we will want to write some custom scripts and automation to build, run, and connect
our containers together.

There is a better way: using Docker Compose.

In this section, you will use Compose to bootstrap a development environment.

---

## What is Docker Compose?

Docker Compose (formerly known as `fig`) is an external tool.

Unlike the Docker Engine, it is written in Python. It's open source as well.

The general idea of Compose is to enable a very simple, powerful onboarding workflow:

1. Checkout your code.

2. Run `docker-compose up`.

3. Your app is up and running!

---

## Compose overview

This is how you work with Compose:

* You describe a set (or stack) of containers in a YAML file called `docker-compose.yml`.

* You run `docker-compose up`.

* Compose automatically pulls images, builds containers, and starts them.

* Compose can set up links, volumes, and other Docker options for you.

* Compose can run the containers in the background, or in the foreground.

* When containers are running in the foreground, their aggregated output is shown.

Before diving in, let's see a small example of Compose in action.

---



![inline](../attachments/composeup.gif)

---

## Checking if Compose is installed

If you are using the official training virtual machines, Compose has been
pre-installed.

If you are using Docker for Mac/Windows or the Docker Toolbox, Compose comes with them.

If you are on Linux (desktop or server environment), you will need to install Compose from its [release page](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases) or with `pip install docker-compose`.

You can always check that it is installed by running:

```bash
$ docker-compose --version
```

---

## Launching Our First Stack with Compose

First step: clone the source code for the app we will be working on.

```bash
$ cd
$ git clone --branch docker https://github.com/DataSystemsGroupUT/dataeng.git
...
$ cd trainingwheels
```


Second step: start your app.

```bash
$ docker-compose up
```

Watch Compose build and run your app with the correct parameters,
including linking the relevant containers together.

---

## Launching Our First Stack with Compose

In a new termina
```bash

docker ps

```

---

![[composeup.gif]]

---

## Stopping the app

When you hit `^C`, Compose tries to gracefully terminate all of the containers.

After ten seconds (or if you press `^C` again) it will forcibly kill
them.

---

## The `docker-compose.yml` file

Here is the file used in the demo:

```yaml
version: "2"

services:
  www:
    build: www
    ports:
      - 8000:5000
    user: nobody
    environment:
      DEBUG: 1
    command: python counter.py
    volumes:
      - ./www:/src

  redis:
    image: redis
```

---

## Compose file structure

A Compose file has multiple sections:

* `version` is mandatory. (We should use `"2"` or later; version 1 is deprecated.)

* `services` is mandatory. A service is one or more replicas of the same image running as containers.

* `networks` is optional and indicates to which networks containers should be connected.
  <br/>(By default, containers will be connected on a private, per-compose-file network.)

* `volumes` is optional and can define volumes to be used and/or shared by the containers.

---

## Compose file versions

* Version 1 is legacy and shouldn't be used.

  (If you see a Compose file without `version` and `services`, it's a legacy v1 file.)

* Version 2 added support for networks and volumes.

* Version 3 added support for deployment options (scaling, rolling updates, etc).

The [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/)
has excellent information about the Compose file format if you need to know more about versions.

---

## Containers in `docker-compose.yml`

Each service in the YAML file must contain either `build`, or `image`.

* `build` indicates a path containing a Dockerfile.

* `image` indicates an image name (local, or on a registry).

* If both are specified, an image will be built from the `build` directory and named `image`.

The other parameters are optional.

They encode the parameters that you would typically add to `docker run`.

Sometimes they have several minor improvements.

---

## Container parameters

* `command` indicates what to run (like `CMD` in a Dockerfile).

* `ports` translates to one (or multiple) `-p` options to map ports.
  <br/>You can specify local ports (i.e. `x:y` to expose public port `x`).

* `volumes` translates to one (or multiple) `-v` options.
  <br/>You can use relative paths here.

For the full list, check: https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/

---

## Compose commands

We already saw `docker-compose up`, but another one is `docker-compose build`.

It will execute `docker build` for all containers mentioning a `build` path.

It can also be invoked automatically when starting the application:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Another common option is to start containers in the background:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

---

## Check container status

It can be tedious to check the status of your containers with `docker ps`,
especially when running multiple apps at the same time.

Compose makes it easier; with `docker-compose ps` you will see only the status of the
containers of the current stack:


```bash
$ docker-compose ps
Name                      Command             State           Ports          
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
trainingwheels_redis_1   /entrypoint.sh red   Up      6379/tcp               
trainingwheels_www_1     python counter.py    Up      0.0.0.0:8000->5000/tcp 
```

---

## Cleaning up (1)

If you have started your application in the background with Compose and
want to stop it easily, you can use the `kill` command:

```bash
$ docker-compose kill
```

Likewise, `docker-compose rm` will let you remove containers (after confirmation):

```bash
$ docker-compose rm
Going to remove trainingwheels_redis_1, trainingwheels_www_1
Are you sure? [yN] y
Removing trainingwheels_redis_1...
Removing trainingwheels_www_1...
```

---

## Cleaning up (2)

Alternatively, `docker-compose down` will stop and remove containers.

It will also remove other resources, like networks that were created for the application.

```bash
$ docker-compose down
Stopping trainingwheels_www_1 ... done
Stopping trainingwheels_redis_1 ... done
Removing trainingwheels_www_1 ... done
Removing trainingwheels_redis_1 ... done
```

Use `docker-compose down -v` to remove everything including volumes.

---

## Special handling of volumes

Compose is smart. If your container uses volumes, when you restart your
application, Compose will create a new container, but carefully re-use
the volumes it was using previously.

This makes it easy to upgrade a stateful service, by pulling its
new image and just restarting your stack with Compose.

---

## Compose project name

* When you run a Compose command, Compose infers the "project name" of your app.

* By default, the "project name" is the name of the current directory.

* For instance, if you are in `/home/zelda/src/ocarina`, the project name is `ocarina`.

* All resources created by Compose are tagged with this project name.

* The project name also appears as a prefix of the names of the resources.

  E.g. in the previous example, service `www` will create a container `ocarina_www_1`.

* The project name can be overridden with `docker-compose -p`.

---

## Running two copies of the same app

If you want to run two copies of the same app simultaneously, all you have to do is to
make sure that each copy has a different project name.

You can:

* copy your code in a directory with a different name

* start each copy with `docker-compose -p myprojname up`

Each copy will run in a different network, totally isolated from the other.

This is ideal to debug regressions, do side-by-side comparisons, etc.
