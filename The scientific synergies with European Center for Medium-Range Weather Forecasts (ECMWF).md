## request

Now they need the help of R&D institutions to complete the chapter "The scientific synergies" of the application. The chapter should describe the following: „Please provide an overview of the surrounding scientific institutions (research centres, centres of excellence, universities, scientific institutes, etc.) in areas relevant to ECMWF activities, such as meteorology, climate, air quality, environmental sciences and services, high-performance computing, AI, Big Data etc.“

They would be very grateful if the institutes/research groups, which consider that they could have some synergy with the 
ECMWF, would briefly describe the following in a few sentences:
-       location,
-       areas of scientific expertise,
-       strategic research objectives,
-       staffing levels and
-       ongoing research projects relevant to ECMWF activities, as well as potential areas of collaboration and synergies with ECMWF.

## group statement

In the Computer Science department of the University of Tartu, the Data System Group (DSG)  carries on research in the Big Data landscape. In particular, our group structure covers three different areas, each of which is lead by a senior researcher.
- The *Graph Processing* cluster investigates how to leverage Big Data solution to perform graph analytics at scale. One Ph.D. student and three master students are actively working in graph data management, benchmarking, and extending frameworks and languages such as Apache Spark, Neo4J/OpenCypher, and GraphQL.
- The *Stream Processing* cluster studies how to make real-time decision making on vast, heterogeneous, and noisy data streams from multiple sources, e.g., sensors or mobile devices. One Ph.D. student and two master students carefully study event-driven architecture based on Apache Kafka, Big Stream Processing systems like Apache Flink and Pulsar.
- The *Learning* cluster focuses on two relevant areas in the AI context, i.e., Explainability and AutoML. The former aims at providing means for understanding black-box machine learning models; the latter investigates how hyperparameter tuning can be automated to speed up Machine Learning engineering. Two Ph.D. students and several master students constitute the most significant DSG sub-group.

Among ECMWF activities, environmental monitoring and hazard prevention and control, are possible research areas where our work can be applied. Moreover, Industry 4.0 and smart-city management are already in the scope. In these regards, the research clusters mentioned above are not isolated silos. The DSG provides an interconnected research environment and encourages the group members to collaborate towards the next generation of analytical systems. Our vision combines inductive yet explainable AI, logical reasoning, graph processing, and real-time analytics. Our medium/long-term vision relates to reactive decision-support systems that analyze a variety of data sources possible at the edge of the computing network. 

Currently, three senior researchers manage the group:
- Dr. Radwa El Shawi, Senior Research.
- Dr. Amed Awad, Senior Reseacher.
- Dr. Riccardo Tommasini, Assistant Professor. 
Relevant industrial collaborations include NIIS (X-ROAD), and several international firms like Playtech, Neo4j, IBM, and InfluxData.	


### ECMWF Relation

Nowadays, Big Data and Artificial Intellingence techniques  are employed in almost every application domain (e.g., weather forecasting, financial applications, advertising, recommendation systems, user behavior analytics). Indeed, abboundace of connected devices (i.e., Internret of Things (IoT)) has raised the industrial interest for data-driven decision makin.  It is well known that large amounts of data coupled with novel Machine Learning (ML) methods can produce results on par with traditional physics based models. Due to an interest in weather monitoring in the general public, today a large number of weather stations are connected to the internet, and are thus available as cheap, distributed computing devices. Although Edge-native Big Data frameworks combined are still a vision, promising results come from the research initiatives around micro-services and distributed stream processing. With large quantities of data, both historical and current measurements, it is an attractive solution to use machine learning in order to predict weather conditions based on these relatively simple data sources. Using a large amount of data together with novel machine learning algorithms can then compensate for lack of complex meteorological models and yield usable forecasts with less computing time. In practice, as the scale of data produced daily is increasing continuously at an exponential scale, distributed machine learning platforms are needed. Machine learning can also be used to improve nowcasting, which is immediate weather prediction, typically within two hours, that provides minute-by-minute precipitation forecasts. While nowcasting is technically possible through traditional forecasting using radar data, weather models based on machine learning can also take into account data from weather satellites. Integrating machine learning into weather models enables them to quickly process satellite images for nowcasting. Adding weather satellites to the tech behind nowcasting greatly expands its reach.
