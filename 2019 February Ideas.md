Can I use vocals to remove the schema registry?

SHACLE WITH imars


chop modality in interval temporal logic is the inverse of SEQ

Push CSprite at broker level.
Modify the kafka protocol so that the broker sends the message to higher levels for “navigating” the hierarchy.

Not all the topics, just those thate are queried

Rethink C sprite for event sourcing

What if the hierarchy represents progressive stages of a pipeline and the system is materializing the next

Secret2: SPY:

So read the paper and I think we can restructure it. But i need some time. Around 10 days.

Title can be: WIRE: gray-box outlook to BigSPEs execution semantics.

I think we can sketch a simulator in Java thar given the input stream with ooo arrivals, the window spec and the reporting spec provides a trace that has:

The output stream, the status of the window at the time of triggering, the status of the engine (for retraction) at the time of reporting. If the window is multi-buffer also a list of windows and their status.

This should allow to execute experiments in which i configure the simulator as my system and 
test some queries

Ideally the simulator can be something like the kafka processor api. Where we can build complex topologies to observe behaviors that are hard to observe with a dist sys running

This can be used for a Nn to complete datalog rules?
